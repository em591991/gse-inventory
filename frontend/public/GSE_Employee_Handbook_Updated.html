                <p>Gulf States Electric (GSE) Integrated, a locally owned and operated electrical contractor, was founded in 2009 by Erik and Shannon Mollerberg. The GSE Integrated headquarters has been located on Jones Creek Road since moving from College Drive in 2019. Our numbers have grown to over thirty full-time employees.</p>
                <p>Originally outfitted for strictly home wiring, GSE has grown in its scope of work to include other departments. These include residential electrical services, new home build wiring, remodels, standby generators, low voltage & alarm systems, and commercial work. Our home wiring departments cover both production homes and custom-built homes. It is GSE's goal to provide customers with a "one-stop-shop" experience where they can receive excellent care for all these electrical services under one name. Our aim is to be the premier electrical company in our service area, with the care and attention of a small business, but with the efficiency and service of a larger company. We feel this is best implemented by each of our employees representing our company's Core Values to a high degree, day in and day out.</p>

                <p>Every employee at GSE Integrated will fall under an assigned job role. These roles outline job duties, expectations, and goals for employees seeking to perform their role at a higher level. Some obligations may require more time than others, and some may require ongoing development, especially if the employee is new to a role, but all are necessary to keep overall company workflows running smoothly. These job roles are also outlined in the company Organizational chart, which is a hierarchy tree that shows the employees who you will work with every day, as well as the direct report infrastructure.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Paid Time Off (PTO) & Leave Policies</h2>
            <div class="subsection-content">
            
            <h4>Paid Vacation</h4>
            <p>Full-time, permanent employees will be eligible for the following PTO allowances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One week PTO (40 hours) at one year of employment</li>
                <li>Two weeks PTO (80 hours) at two years</li>
                <li>Three weeks PTO (120 hours) at five years</li>
                <li>Four weeks PTO (160 hours) at ten years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Vacation hours will be given annually on the employee's anniversary date. Employment must be continuous, and the accrual of PTO will restart if it is interrupted. Any unused PTO time will be paid out on the employee's anniversary date and replaced by the appropriate amount for the next year.</p>
            
            <h4>Paid Holidays</h4>
            <p>After one (1) year of employment, employees will be paid 8 regular time hours per each of the following holidays:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New Year's Day (January 1st)</li>
                <li>Good Friday (Friday before Easter Sunday)</li>
                <li>Memorial Day (Last Monday of May)</li>
                <li>July 4th</li>
                <li>Labor Day (First Monday of September)</li>
                <li>Thanksgiving Day (Fourth Thursday in November)</li>
                <li>Christmas Day (December 25th)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a holiday falls on a weekend, GSE Integrated will observe said holiday on the previous Friday or following Monday at the discretion of management.</p>
            
            <h4>Unpaid Leave</h4>
            <p>If an employee does not have vacation hours but would like to be scheduled off for a time, this is still possible. A time off request form should be filled out, and upon approval, the employee may take off the specified days without pay or penalty.</p>
            
            <h4>Bereavement Pay</h4>
            <p>Following a death in the family, employees may receive up to three days of paid leave. This applies to immediate family members only including the following: spouse or domestic partner, mother, father, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, stepsiblings, or grandparents. The allotted bereavement days can be continuous or spread out as needed to accommodate grieving, arrangements, and the funeral. All bereavement days must be taken within 14 days of the family member's passing.</p>
            
            <h4>Maternity & Paternity Leave</h4>
            <p>GSE Integrated is committed to supporting our employees in their personal lives and easing the burden new parents may face. All employees who have been employed for one year are eligible for five days of paid leave following the birth of their child. This week may be taken all at once or on non-consecutive days, but they must all be used within four weeks of the child's birth.</p>
            
            <h4>Jury Duty & Military Leave</h4>
            <p>If you are required to report to jury duty or a military arrangement, these days will be excused without pay. Your job is protected during this time, and you will not be considered for replacement due to extended leave. In some situations, employees may be able to perform their job duties outside of their time spent on these obligations and may receive full or partial compensation. This will be determined by senior management and communicated beforehand.</p>
            
            <h4>Extended Personal Leave</h4>
            <p>Employees who have been with GSE Integrated for at least one year may apply for a personal leave of absence for up to eight weeks. Extended leaves are unpaid, though accrued vacation time may be used. When considering a request for a personal leave, GSE Integrated will consider factors such as the employee's position, the employee's length of service, the employee's performance record including attendance, the purpose of the leave, the needs of the department in which the employee works, the effect of the leave on other employees, and general business needs. Medical benefits will continue on the same basis as if the employee were actively working.</p>
            <p>GSE Integrated cannot guarantee reinstatement upon return from an extended leave. GSE Integrated will, however, make a reasonable effort to place the employee in an available position for which he or she is qualified. If such a position is not available, then the employee's employment will terminate. Even in that event, the employee may later apply for reemployment.</p>
            <p>Employees who fail to report to work after an approved leave of absence are deemed to have voluntarily resigned. When an approved leave has been exhausted, the employee may request additional leave. Ownership must approve all extended leave.</p>

            <h4>Office Employees (Hourly)</h4>
            <p>Employees should clock in for the workday when arriving at the office. If the employee has non-working obligations outside of the office, they should clock out for the duration, and clock back in when they return to the office. If the office employee is temporarily working from home, they should be clocked in when they are working, available by phone, and have immediate access to their work computer â€“ if this is not the case, the employee should clock out until such requirements are met.</p>
            
            <h4>Field Employees (Hourly)</h4>
            <p>Field employees driving to the office before their first call should not clock in until they are at the shop. Shop time is to be used to restock for upcoming jobs and unload materials as needed.</p>
            <p>Field employees driving straight to their first job should clock in when they arrive on-site. When technicians finish their last job for the day they should clock out. Any drive to the first or from the last call of the day exceeding 45 miles will be paid out at 2 minutes per mile for any excess over 45 miles; for example, a 75-mile drive for the first call of the day would pay for 30 miles, or 60 minutes. This does not apply to any "on-call" jobs where you would clock in when you leave home for the job and clock out when the job is finished.</p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the employee's direct supervisor to track these commutes â€“ they will determine which routes qualify for additional pay, and they will provide this information to accounting. It is not necessary for you to change your timesheet in any way to receive this pay. Notifying your supervisor that a drive exceeded the 45-mile threshold is helpful in ensuring it is recorded.</p>

The company may close for part of a workday, or in the worst circumstances the company may close altogether for several days or more until conditions improve. Depending on your position, you may be asked to work remotely in a full or partial capacity, or to assume job responsibilities outside of your typical role.</p>
            <p>In the event of such emergencies, employees are expected to keep an open line of communication with management. It is important for the company to know who is and is not available, and when they may be able to return to work and at what capacity.</p>
            <p>During this time, benefits such as health insurance coverage will continue. Pay for employees will be dependent on whether they are able to work remotely or have other involvement for the benefit of the company.</p>

            <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>GSE Integrated operates primarily as an "on-site" company. Employees are expected to report to the office during business hours to receive their compensation. Working remotely is a privilege reserved for abnormal situations, and only if your job duties allow it. If you foresee the need to work remotely, you must contact your direct manager who will decide if this is allowed. It is never acceptable to miss working at the office without prior notice. Giving as much notice is recommended, and while it does not guarantee approval, it increases the likelihood that we will be able to accommodate you. Remote work is most likely to be granted for reasons such as inclement weather, emergencies, and personal health issues.</p>
            <p>While working remotely, employees should continue their work seamlessly as if they were in the office setting. Punctual completion of job duties and availability to communicate with other employees, customers, and vendors is crucial.</p>
            <p>In the situation where an employee is allowed to work remotely, it will be their responsibility to keep a record of the scope of their work during that time. They may be asked to present these items to management for review. If an employee is found to be abusing this remote work privilege, or if their work is subpar or incomplete, they may be suspended or banned from future remote work opportunities.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Time-Off Requests</h2>
            <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>When an employee plans to miss work, a time-off request form should be filled out and submitted to management. Keep in mind this is a request and is subject to approval or denial. Employees may be denied if a request for the same time has already been approved for another employee in their department. Forms should be filled out for paid time off (PTO), unpaid leave, and bereavement pay. It is encouraged to complete these forms and submit them to management with as much notice as possible, as this will increase the chances of approval. The form used to submit time-off requests will not allow you to request dates less than a week away. If you are trying to request off with this minimal notice, you will need to contact your supervisor directly.</p>

            <p>Payroll is processed by the accounting department weekly and paid out at the end of the week on Friday. Each pay period runs from Sunday through Saturday. It is paid by direct deposit, and a virtual pay stub is uploaded into QuickBooks, with a reminder e-mail sent to your contact on file. We encourage employees to review this on a weekly basis to ensure their pay is correct. If there are any discrepancies, please contact the accounting department immediately.</p>
            <p>If changes need to be made to your paycheck such as tax withholding, 401k contributions, or vacation usage, they need to be submitted as early in the week as possible. Most employees should report this directly to their supervisor â€“ managers can use the accounting form workflow to notify the accounting department. Requests made too late in the week run the risk of being pushed to the following week's paycheck.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Employee Conduct Scorecard</h2>
            <div class="subsection-content">
            
            <h4>Scorecard Breakdown</h4>
            <p>We are committed to creating a safe, respectful, and productive environment for all employees. To ensure the success of our team and to maintain a high standard of professionalism, we have implemented a scorecard system that evaluates key aspects of employee behavior. This system allows us to fairly measure employee conduct across several areas. By applying the same criteria to everyone, we aim to provide a consistent process that encourages accountability, personal growth, and success.</p>
            <p>The scorecard focuses on five critical areas: Driving Safety, Work Attendance, Respect and Professionalism, Insubordination, and Negligence. Each of these categories plays a vital role in our company's operations and the safety and wellbeing of our employees.</p>
            
            <h4>Driving Safety</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Employee safety is paramount. Any violations related to unsafe driving practices or exceeding speed limits while operating company vehicles will result in points being added to the employee's score.</p>
            <p><strong>Point Allocation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 point for failing to adhere to speed limits or traffic regulations on the job.</li>
                <li>3 points for minor driving violations (e.g., improper vehicle maintenance, severe instances of speeding).</li>
                <li>5 points for serious driving violations (e.g., Reckless driving, accidents caused by negligence, inappropriate actions towards other drivers).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Work Attendance</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Consistent attendance is crucial for maintaining workflows and meeting deadlines. Unscheduled absences, tardiness, or leaving early without proper authorization disrupt the team's productivity.</p>
            <p><strong>Point Allocation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 point for arriving to work after your scheduled start time without prior approval.</li>
                <li>3 points for arriving to work excessively late without approval, unavailability during the workday, improper use of the time clock or failure to work during "clocked-in" hours.</li>
                <li>5 points for "No call, no shows."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Respect and Professionalism</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> We expect all employees to treat others with respect and maintain a professional demeanor in all situations. This includes interactions with co-workers, supervisors, vendors, and customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Point Allocation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 point for minor infractions such as consistently unprofessional behavior or minor disputes with colleagues.</li>
                <li>3 points for inappropriate behavior or language that undermines team morale or professionalism.</li>
                <li>5 points for incidents involving harassment, discrimination, or behavior that severely disrupts the work environment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Insubordination</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Employees are expected to follow instructions and respect company policies. Any actions demonstrating insubordination, failure to follow direct instructions, or disrespect towards reporting managers will result in consequences.</p>
            <p><strong>Point Allocation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 point for occasional failure to comply with minor instructions or a single instance.</li>
                <li>3 points for repeated disregard of instructions or refusal to comply with company policies.</li>
                <li>5 points for failure to comply with a direct request from a supervisor or manager.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Negligence</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Employees are expected to be vigilant, attentive, and responsible in performing their duties. Negligence includes any failure to attend to important tasks, damage caused by inattention to work, careless injury to self or others, or accidents that occur due to distracted driving or careless actions.</p>
            <p><strong>Point Allocation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 point for minor negligence, such as overlooking small but important details that affect work quality or safety.</li>
                <li>3 points for moderate negligence, such as errors that lead to production delays, minor damage, or failure to report critical issues in a timely manner.</li>
                <li>5 points for major incidents of negligence, such as significant property damage, major safety violations, or vehicle accidents caused by distracted driving.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Point System & Termination Criteria</h3>
            <p>An employee who accumulates 15 points in any category or through a combination of categories within the calendar year will face termination. This policy ensures that we uphold high standards of safety, professionalism, and operational efficiency.</p>
            <p>However, it is important to note that GSE Integrated reserves the right, in extreme cases, to bypass the point accrual process and immediately terminate an employee for any reason, particularly in situations involving severe misconduct or safety violations. This may include, but is not limited to, incidents of violence, theft, gross negligence, or any behavior that puts the safety or wellbeing of others at risk. Such actions will be addressed immediately and without the need to follow the point system.</p>
            <p>At the end of each calendar year, all points accumulated by an employee will be reset to zero. This allows employees the opportunity to start fresh and work towards improving their performance and behavior in the new year. Records will be kept, however, of previously documented point allocations.</p>
            <p>We believe that this system will help maintain a positive, respectful, and productive work environment for all employees at GSE Integrated. Our goal is to foster accountability, personal growth, and a commitment to excellence. By adhering to these standards, we can ensure both individual and collective success.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or need clarification regarding this policy, please contact your direct report.</p>

            <div class="hr-content">
            
            <h3>Performance Reviews</h3>
            <p>All employees will be subject to, at minimum, a yearly performance review with their direct reporting manager and senior management. The scope of these meetings will vary based on job position, but will review items such as job performance, attendance, attitude, past and future goals, promotions, pay increases, and benefit adjustments. Increases in pay are never guaranteed, but we encourage managers to recommend rewards for team members who are excelling in their job position. There will not be any forced ranking or comparison between employees as our goal is to help everyone improve and develop their careers with GSE Integrated.</p>
            <p>Employees are encouraged to interact with management on a regular basis outside of these performance reviews to set goals, receive and give feedback, and ensure they are in good standing with their work.</p>
            
            <h3>Promotional Eligibility</h3>
            <p>GSE Integrated is committed to the ongoing development of our employees. With time, commitment, and a high level of work quality, promotions and growth within the company are always possible. It is our goal whenever possible to promote people from within the company as opposed to outside hiring. Working with management to create a road map of skills that can be gained or goals to be met to qualify for a promotion is always encouraged.</p>
            
            <h3>Open-Door Policy</h3>
            <p>We want to foster an environment where employees know their voice will be heard. Employees should feel comfortable asking for feedback, expressing concerns about their jobs or that of others, seeking resolutions to a dispute, suggesting changes, or discussing other personal topics. Your direct reporting managers should be approached first, but if necessary upper management or ownership will become involved in the event an initial meeting does not resolve the matter in question. In the case of harassment or complaints against your direct manager, or if prior attempts to reach out to your manager have been unsuccessful, you should report to senior management.</p>
            <p>If requesting a meeting with management, it is suggested as a courtesy (when possible) to ask in advance to meet with them so they can give you the appropriate attention.</p>
            
            <h3>Grievance Procedures</h3>
            <p>Misunderstandings and conflicts can arise in any organization. To ensure effective working relationships between all employees, it is important that these matters are resolved quickly before they become more widespread or affect company culture or productivity. Employees are encouraged to resolve minor incidents without intervention from others â€“ this can often be done through non-confrontational conversations. If a situation is ongoing or unable to be resolved easily, you should follow the three-step process listed below:</p>
            <p><strong>Step One:</strong> Discuss the issue with your direct reporting manager. They may consult with other management staff if necessary to help resolve the problem or escalate the issue in serious situations. If you don't believe a conversation with this person is appropriate, or that a conversation was unproductive, proceed to step two.</p>
            <p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Request a meeting with the Integrator (found on the company organizational chart). They will consult with your direct reporting manager if necessary and may also escalate an issue as needed. If you feel that the meeting was unproductive and problem is unresolved, proceed to step three.</p>
            <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Request a meeting with the Visionary (found on the company organizational chart). The Visionary will investigate the problem and make a final decision. All subordinate management will be informed of the outcome, and business should proceed under those guidelines.</p>
            <p>GSE Integrated managers and employees will not retaliate against another employee for utilizing this procedure; however, the company is not required to consider or review frivolous complaints or those submitted in bad faith. Once an issue has been reviewed and a response is not deemed necessary, there is no obligation to review additional complaints on the same subject.</p>

            <p>We will not be lenient in cases of assault, sexual harassment or workplace violence, whether physical or psychological. We will terminate employees who behave in this manner immediately.</p>
            <p>If you are the victim of discriminatory behavior (or if you suspect that others are being discriminated against), please talk to senior management as soon as possible. They are responsible for hearing your claim, investigating the issue and determining punishment.</p>

            <p>GSE Integrated is committed to ensuring both the physical and mental health of all its employees in the workplace, both in the office and in the field. This includes protecting against unsafe air quality, harmfully loud noises, toxic or otherwise dangerous materials, etc. We are taking measures to provide employees with the proper skills and protective equipment to avoid workplace incidents or unhealthy conditions.</p>
            <p>If you are aware of any situation posing a health threat to you or any other employee, please contact management immediately. Furthermore, if you need personal protective equipment (PPE) or any training such as how to operate power tools, how to safely navigate heights or attics, etc., please bring it to our attention.</p>
            <p>Personal illness is a concern for the health and safety of the company. If you are sick, and unsure of the cause, please consult a medical professional. We encourage all employees to ensure that they are non-contagious and pose no threat to other employees before returning to the workplace.

            <p>In an instance where an unsafe environment is caused by another person (such as a threatening demeanor), whether customer, vendor, or other employee, we ask that you do your best to avoid engagement with them.

            <div class="subsection-content">
            
            <h4>Vehicle Usage</h4>
            <p>Company vehicles are provided to authorized employees to support their business activities. These vehicles are for traveling to and from job sites and the GSE office. In some cases, employees may be permitted to take the company vehicle home and use it to commute to and from their home and GSE office and/or jobsites. They are not to be used for personal errands, or any other commitments outside of business hours. Furthermore, the vehicles are exclusively for company employees â€“ non-employees should never operate or ride in company vehicles.</p>
            <p>To use a company vehicle, employees must maintain an active driver's license and pass a Motor Vehicle Record (MVR). If for any reason, an employee's driver's license is revoked, suspended, or restricted, it is mandatory that management be notified immediately.</p>
            <p>While operating a company vehicle, employees should observe the following standards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obey all motor vehicle laws under all circumstances</li>
                <li>Seatbelt should be always worn</li>
                <li>Operate the vehicle in a safe and courteous manner â€“ remember you are driving a GSE billboard, and all activity is a direct reflection of our company</li>
                <li>Drive defensively to prevent injuries and property damage</li>
                <li>Avoid texting while driving (or use of other devices that would lead to distractions) â€“ only "hands-free" calling is allowed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Vehicle Inspections</h4>
            <p>All employees with a company vehicle will be subjected to monthly vehicle inspections. This will ensure that documentation is up to date, GSE tools and equipment are in good condition and safely secured, and that the vehicle is well maintained and is free of damage or trash. If an employee fails more than one inspection in a four-month period, they will be required to leave their vehicle at the shop every day, and the commute to and from work must be done in their personal vehicle. Repeated failures, or failed inspections of a severe nature, may result in further consequences up to and including termination of employment. These situations will be taken on a case-by-case basis by management and will also be considered during annual employee reviews.</p>
            <p>With these inspections in mind, it is the employee's responsibility to keep their vehicle in exceptional condition. This includes regular cleaning of both the inside and outside, as well as inspecting the vehicle periodically to ensure documentation is up to date and that no damage has occurred. Resources are given to the employees to submit requests when oil changes or other maintenance items are needed â€“ management will schedule these visits with the appropriate automative shops but tracking when these visits are due falls on the employee. Please refer to the vehicle inspection checklist to ensure you are aware of all necessary maintenance items for which you are responsible.</p>
            <p>The privilege of driving a company vehicle may be withdrawn for any of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abuse or misuse of the vehicle or failure to comply with the rules and procedures stipulated in this company policy.</li>
                <li>A driving record which becomes deficient while operating a company vehicle.</li>
                <li>Conviction or a guilty plea to driving a company vehicle under the influence of alcohol or an illegal controlled substance.</li>
                <li>If an eligible driver has a long-term disability, his/her assigned vehicle could be reassigned to another driver. Upon recovery from the disability and return to work, the driver may be assigned another vehicle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Company vehicles should not be used to transport flammable items, firearms, or other hazardous materials. Smoking is not allowed in company vehicles.</p>
            <p>No modifications should be made to a company vehicle, aesthetically or mechanically, without prior consent from management.</p>
            
            <h4>Camera Policy</h4>
            <p>All company vehicles come equipped with both forward and rear facing dash cams. These are in place to protect the company from liability regarding accidents. The cameras are a non-negotiable part of our insurance policy. Any employee removing, repositioning, covering, or otherwise tampering with any vehicle's camera will be terminated immediately.</p>
            
            <h4>Fuel Cards</h4>
            <p>All employees using a company car or truck will be given a fleet card. This is used only for refueling company vehicles and will require information such as the odometer reading to purchase gas. Any spending outside of fuel must be approved by your direct manager. If this card is ever lost or stolen, or if fraud is suspected, it should be reported immediately to management.</p>
            
            <h4>Traffic Violations</h4>
            <p>In the event an employee is ticketed by law enforcement in a company vehicle, they will be responsible for the cost. If the cause is due to impairment (drugs or alcohol), or general negligence (for example, texting while driving), the employee may be held responsible for damages and may be subject to paycheck deductions or further consequences.</p>
            
            <h4>Vehicle Accidents</h4>
            <p>If you are involved in an accident, theft, or damage to your vehicle, it is necessary to follow the procedure outlined below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If anyone is hurt, call for medical assistance.</li>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Technician Tool Policy</h2>
            <div class="subsection-content">
            <p><strong>Hand Tools:</strong> Field technicians are expected to provide and maintain their own kit of basic hand tools. Every technician is expected to have a hammer (less than 20 oz), 25' tape measure, side cutting pliers (dykes), Klein's crimping pliers, Klein's 11-in-1 screwdriver, large flathead screwdriver, razor knife, plug tester, and wire strippers. Management and maintenance of these items is up to the individual employee, and they will bear all responsibility for the upkeep and replacement of said tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Power Tools:</strong> GSE Integrated will provide power tools for field employees. These include cordless drills, impacts, reciprocating saw (Sawzall), and a multi-tool. Tool allocations may vary between field technicians based on job description and experience. These items will be marked and tracked as they are checked out to an employee and their vehicle. Checks will be conducted periodically to evaluate the condition of the tools and ensure they are still accounted for and in working order. In the case where tools are lost or damaged/broken due to negligence, the employee will be held liable. GSE Integrated will assume liability for power tools needing replacement due to normal "wear and tear" on the items. Any damage to a tool should be reported and documented immediately.</p>
            <p>GSE Integrated maintains a stock of power and accessory tools at the main warehouse/office. These are available for all field employees as needed and should only be distributed by projects managers or the warehouse manager. Any tool that is removed from or returned to GSE should be documented in the Monday.com board titled Tool List.</p>
            <p>For some field positions, there may be power tools that are required frequently enough that it is warranted to permanently keep it on the work vehicle. These will still be checked out from the tool stock, on a permanent basis, until the tool requires replacement, job duties change in a way that the tool is no longer required, or termination of employment.</p>
            <p>If there is a power tool which the company does not currently stock, but an employee feels it may be useful to keep, please make a request through your direct manager. They will review this with the appropriate personnel and the tool may be purchased and added to our stock.</p>
            <p>If employment is terminated for any reason, employees are responsible for returning any tools assigned to them. Failure to do so may result in withholding from the employee's paycheck.</p>

            <p>In some instances, GSE Integrated may hold an employee liable for damage to company property, or to a customer or vendor's property. If damage is caused in any situation, it should be reported immediately to your manager. Your manager and admin will determine the scope and cause of the damage. If it is determined the employee caused damage due to an unavoidable accident, then GSE will cover the costs. If the manager/admin determines the damage was due to negligence, the cost may fall on the employee. This will be up to the manager/admin's discretion. If the employee fails to report damages to one's manager, and it is later discovered, negligence will automatically be assumed, and employees may be held liable.</p>
            <p>All incidents should be reported by managers immediately via the provided JotForm link. All situations should be reviewed with the accounting department before moving forward with any resolution with the employee, customer, or vendor. Concessions, refunds, and reimbursements should not be given until this review process is completed.</p>
