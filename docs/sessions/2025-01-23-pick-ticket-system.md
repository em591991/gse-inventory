# Session Summary: Pick Ticket PDF System - January 23, 2025

## üéØ Session Goals
1. Set up development environment at camp computer
2. Build pick ticket PDF generation system
3. Create REST API endpoint for downloads
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Environment Setup - COMPLETE**

#### Issues Encountered:
- Python not in PATH (used `py` launcher instead)
- Virtual environment activation policy
- Fresh database needed migrations
- Missing `jobs/0002_workorder.py` migration from previous session
- Broken `inventory/urls.py` with invalid ViewSet imports

#### Solutions Applied:
- Used `py -m venv venv` for environment creation
- Set PowerShell execution policy for activation
- Manually created missing migration file
- Fixed inventory URLs to remove broken imports
- Ran all migrations successfully

**Key Learning:** The missing migration was never created in the previous session - the WorkOrder model was added but `makemigrations` was never run for it.

---

### 2. **Test Data Creation - COMPLETE**

Created professional test data script: `backend/create_test_data.py`

**Data Created:**
- 1 UnitOfMeasure (EA - Each)
- 1 Location (Main Warehouse)
- 3 Items:
  - WN-RED-100: Wire Nuts - Red ($5.00)
  - WIRE-12-BLK: 12 AWG Wire - Black ($0.50)
  - BOX-4SQ: 4-Square Metal Box ($2.25)
- 1 Customer (ACME Construction)
- 1 Sales Order with 3 order lines

**Script Features:**
- Idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- Uses get_or_create for no duplicates
- Professional console output
- Proper Django setup for standalone execution

---

### 3. **Pick Ticket PDF Generator - COMPLETE**

Created `backend/orders/pick_ticket_service.py` (294 lines)

#### Core Class: `PickTicketGenerator`

**Features Implemented:**
- Professional PDF layout using ReportLab
- Letter size (8.5" √ó 11")
- Custom paragraph styles for headers/titles
- Code128 barcode generation
- Multi-section document structure

**PDF Sections:**

1. **Header**
   - Large "PICK TICKET" title
   - Barcode of order ID for scanning

2. **Order Information Table**
   - Order ID (truncated for display)
   - Date (current date)
   - Customer name
   - Order status
   - Job code and name (if applicable)

3. **Items Table**
   - Column headers: Line | G-Code | Description | Qty | UOM | Location | Picked
   - Professional styling with gray header background
   - Grid lines for clarity
   - Location lookup from item default bins
   - Checkbox column (‚òê) for warehouse staff

4. **Footer**
   - Order notes (if any)
   - Signature lines:
     - Picked By / Date / Time
     - Verified By / Date / Time

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `SimpleDocTemplate` for page layout
- Custom `TableStyle` for professional appearance
- Barcode integration with `python-barcode` library
- BytesIO buffer for in-memory PDF generation
- Error handling for barcode failures

**Styling:**
- Header: #4a4a4a background, white text
- Grid: #cccccc lines
- Professional spacing and padding
- Proper alignment (right-aligned quantities, centered checkboxes)

---

### 4. **REST API Endpoint - COMPLETE**

Created `backend/orders/api_views.py`

#### Endpoint: `GET /api/orders/{order_id}/pick-ticket/`

**Functionality:**
- Validates order exists (404 if not found)
- Checks order type is SALES (400 if not)
- Ensures order has line items (400 if empty)
- Generates PDF using PickTicketGenerator
- Returns PDF with proper content-type
- Sets download filename: `pick_ticket_{order_id_prefix}.pdf`

**Error Handling:**
- 400 BAD REQUEST: Wrong order type or no lines
- 404 NOT FOUND: Order doesn't exist
- 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR: PDF generation failure

**Response Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="pick_ticket_d39b0999.pdf"
```

---

### 5. **URL Routing - COMPLETE**

Created `backend/orders/urls.py`

**Route Added:**
```python
path('<uuid:order_id>/pick-ticket/', 
     api_views.download_pick_ticket, 
     name='download_pick_ticket')
```

**Updated `backend/backend_app/urls.py`:**
```python
path('api/orders/', include('orders.urls'))
```

**Full URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api/orders/{uuid}/pick-ticket/`

---

### 6. **Bug Fixes - COMPLETE**

#### Issue 1: Missing Migration
**Problem:** `inventory/0003` and `0004` depended on `jobs/0002_workorder` which didn't exist

**Solution:** Created `backend/jobs/migrations/0002_workorder.py` manually with proper WorkOrder model fields

**Migration Details:**
- Creates WorkOrder table
- Fields: work_order_id, wo_number, title, status, scheduled_date, department
- Foreign key to Job model
- Proper db_column attributes matching ERD

#### Issue 2: Broken inventory/urls.py
**Problem:** File had invalid imports from old ViewSets that don't exist

**Solution:** Cleaned up to only import `api_views` and removed all ViewSet references

#### Issue 3: Wrong Related Name
**Problem:** Code used `order.orderline_set` but actual related name is `order.lines`

**Solution:** Updated pick_ticket_service.py line 190 to use correct related name

## üìù Key Decisions Made

### 1. **ReportLab over WeasyPrint**
**Decision:** Use ReportLab for PDF generation

**Reasoning:**
- Pure Python, no external dependencies
- Built-in barcode support
- Precise layout control
- Faster rendering
- Better for structured documents like pick tickets

### 2. **Test Data Script Approach**
**Decision:** Create standalone Python script instead of Django fixtures

**Reasoning:**
- More flexible and readable
- Can run multiple times safely (get_or_create)
- Easy to customize for different scenarios
- Better for development/testing
- Shows output to confirm success

### 3. **API Design - Direct PDF Download**
**Decision:** Return PDF directly instead of JSON with URL

**Reasoning:**
- Simpler for frontend (one request)
- No need for file storage/cleanup
- Immediate download in browser
- Standard REST pattern for file downloads
- Proper HTTP headers for browser handling

---

## üîß Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Python Path Issues
**Problem:** `python` command not found on camp computer

**Solution:** Used `py` launcher which is standard on Windows
- `py -m venv venv` to create environment
- `py --version` to check installation

**Time Lost:** 10 minutes

---

### Challenge 2: Missing Migration Dependency
**Problem:** Django couldn't build migration graph due to missing `jobs/0002_workorder`

**Root Cause:** Previous session added WorkOrder model but never ran `makemigrations jobs`

**Solution:** 
1. Examined existing migrations to understand dependencies
2. Manually created migration file with correct structure
3. Used proper Django migration format
4. Verified all fields match WorkOrder model

**Discovery:** The WorkOrder model was committed but its migration wasn't - this was a legitimate oversight from previous session, not a sync issue.

**Time Lost:** 30 minutes (debugging + fix)

---

### Challenge 3: Field Name Mismatches
**Problem:** Test data creation failed with field name errors
- Expected `abbr`, actual field is `uom_code`
- Expected `location_type`, actual field is `type`
- Expected `uom`, actual field is `default_uom`
- Expected `customer_name`, actual field is `name`

**Solution:** Checked actual model fields using `Model._meta.fields` before creating data

**Prevention:** Always introspect models when unsure about field names

**Time Lost:** 15 minutes

---

### Challenge 4: Shell Variable Loss
**Problem:** Django shell lost variables when switching contexts

**Solution:** Created standalone script (`create_test_data.py`) instead of using shell
- More reliable
- Repeatable
- Can version control
- Better for documentation

**Time Lost:** 5 minutes (minimal, quick pivot)

---

### Challenge 5: Wrong Related Name
**Problem:** `order.orderline_set` attribute doesn't exist

**Root Cause:** OrderLine model defines `related_name='lines'`

**Solution:** Changed to `order.lines.all()` in pick_ticket_service.py

**How Found:** Inspected Order model fields using `Order._meta.get_fields()`

**Time Lost:** 5 minutes
