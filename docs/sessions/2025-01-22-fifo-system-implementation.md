# Session Summary: FIFO System Implementation - January 22, 2025

## üéØ Session Goals
1. Implement complete FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory costing system
2. Build negative inventory support with pending allocations
3. Create REST API endpoints for inventory operations
4. Test all functionality end-to-end

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Database Models - COMPLETE**

#### New Models Created:
- **InventoryLayer** - Tracks cost layers for FIFO allocation
  - Fields: layer_id, item_id, location_id, bin_id, qty_remaining, unit_cost, received_at, purchase_order_id, reference
  - Indexes: FIFO lookup (item, location, received_at), individual field indexes
  - Purpose: Each inventory receipt creates a new layer with its specific cost

- **PendingAllocation** - Manages negative inventory scenarios
  - Fields: pending_allocation_id, item_id, location_id, work_order_id, order_id, qty, estimated_unit_cost, estimated_total_cost, status, created_at, fulfilled_at
  - Status enum: AWAITING_RECEIPT, PARTIALLY_FULFILLED, FULFILLED, CANCELED
  - Purpose: Tracks materials allocated but not yet in stock

#### Models Updated:
- **Item**
  - Added: current_replacement_cost (for quoting new jobs)
  - Added: last_cost_update (timestamp)
  - Method: update_replacement_cost()

- **InventoryMovement**
  - Added: unit_cost (cost per unit at time of movement)
  - Added: total_cost (qty √ó unit_cost)
  - Added: is_estimated (true if from pending allocation)
  - Added: actual_cost_variance (difference between estimated and actual)
  - Added: order, order_line, reference fields
  - Enhanced: Auto-calculate total_cost in save()

- **WorkOrder** (in jobs app)
  - Created complete model: work_order_id, job, wo_number, title, status, scheduled_date, department
  - Method: get_material_cost() for job costing

#### Migrations:
- Created and applied migrations for all model changes
- Migration file: `inventory/migrations/0004_inventorymovement_order_inventorymovement_order_line_and_more.py`
- All tables created successfully in database

---

### 2. **FIFO Inventory Service - COMPLETE**

### 4. **Testing - COMPLETE**

#### FIFO Logic Testing:
**Test Scenario:**
- Received 100 units @ $5.00 (Layer 1)
- Received 100 units @ $6.00 (Layer 2)
- Allocated 50 units ‚Üí Pulled from Layer 1 @ $5.00 ‚úÖ
- Allocated 75 units ‚Üí 50 from Layer 1 + 25 from Layer 2 ‚úÖ
- Total cost: (50 √ó $5) + (25 √ó $6) = $400 ‚úÖ

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ FIFO working correctly - oldest inventory consumed first
- ‚úÖ Cross-layer allocation working - spans multiple cost layers
- ‚úÖ Cost calculations accurate to the penny
- ‚úÖ Layer qty_remaining updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Inventory movements track costs properly

#### API Testing:
**Tests Performed:**
- GET /api/inventory/available/ ‚Üí 200 OK, returned correct quantity (75 units)
- POST /api/inventory/receive/ ‚Üí 201 Created, created layer successfully
- POST /api/inventory/allocate/ ‚Üí 200 OK, allocated 30 units for $180 (30 √ó $6)
- All endpoints return proper status codes
- Response data matches expected schema
- Error handling works (400/404/500 responses)

**Test Environment:**
- Django Test Client
- Test item: TEST-FIFO-001 (Test Wire Nuts)
- Test location: Main Warehouse
- Settings override: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['testserver', '*']

---

## üìù Key Decisions Made

### 1. **FIFO Costing Method**
**Decision:** Implement full FIFO with inventory layer tracking

**Reasoning:**
- Most accurate job costing
- Matches physical flow of materials (oldest used first)
- Industry standard for construction
- Better for price variance analysis
- More complex but worth it for accuracy

**Implementation:**
- Each receipt creates a new layer with specific cost
- Allocations pull from oldest layers first
- Layers track qty_remaining and unit_cost
- Movements record actual costs from layers

---

### 2. **Negative Inventory Strategy**
**Decision:** Allow negative inventory with pending allocation tracking

**Reasoning:**
- Jobs can't be blocked by temporary stock shortages (real-world need)
- System tracks what's owed when inventory arrives
- Uses estimated costs until fulfilled
- Automatic fulfillment reduces manual work
- Cost variance tracking improves future estimates

**Implementation:**
- PendingAllocation model tracks shortages
- Uses current_replacement_cost as estimate
- Creates estimated inventory movements
- Auto-fulfills when matching inventory received
- Calculates variance between estimated and actual cost

---

### 3. **Cost Display Strategy**
**Decision:** Show both actual FIFO cost AND current replacement cost

**Reasoning:**
- Actual FIFO cost: For job profitability and costing completed jobs
- Current replacement cost: For quoting new jobs accurately
- Variance tracking: Shows savings from using old inventory or price increases
- Helps with bidding: "Wire nuts cost $5 but now $6, adjust quotes"

**Fields Added:**
- InventoryMovement.unit_cost = actual cost from FIFO layer
- InventoryMovement.total_cost = qty √ó unit_cost
- Item.current_replacement_cost = latest purchase price (for quotes)
- InventoryMovement.actual_cost_variance = difference when estimated

---

### 4. **API Design Approach**
**Decision:** RESTful APIs with comprehensive response data

**Reasoning:**
- Standard REST conventions (GET/POST)
- Rich response data for UI needs
- Separate estimate endpoint for cost preview
- Clear error messages with proper status codes
- Support for optional parameters (bin_id, work_order_id)

**Features:**
- Cost estimation without allocation
- Layer breakdown for transparency
- Pending allocation visibility
- Transfer operations preserve costs

---

### 5. **Transaction Safety**
**Decision:** Use @transaction.atomic decorators on all write operations

**Reasoning:**
- Ensures data consistency
- Prevents partial updates on errors
- Critical for inventory accuracy
- Rollback on any failure
- Thread-safe operations

**Applied To:**
- receive_inventory()
- allocate_inventory_fifo()
- transfer_inventory()
- All allocation helper methods

---

## üîß Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Field Name Mismatches
**Problem:** Service tried to use fields that didn't exist in InventoryMovement (order, reference)

**Solution:**
- Updated InventoryMovement model with missing fields
- Added order, order_line, reference to model
- Created and ran migration
- Verified all fields present before testing

**Time Lost:** 15 minutes

---

### Challenge 2: ALLOWED_HOSTS for Test Client
**Problem:** Django Test Client requires 'testserver' in ALLOWED_HOSTS

**Solution:**
- Settings override: `settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['testserver', '*']`
- Alternative: Update settings.py permanently
- Used override approach for testing flexibility

**Time Lost:** 10 minutes

---

### Challenge 3: Duplicate Test Runs
**Problem:** User accidentally ran allocation test twice, causing confusion with results

**Solution:**
- Checked movement history to diagnose
- Found duplicate movements with same reference
- Explained what happened (user error, not system bug)
- Verified FIFO logic was actually working correctly

**Discovery:** FIFO system was perfect - movements 4 & 5 showed correct cross-layer allocation

**Time Lost:** 20 minutes (but valuable verification)
