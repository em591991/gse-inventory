2. Understand complete workflow for sales orders and job costing
3. Design FIFO inventory costing system
4. Define business rules for negative inventory and backorders
5. Establish reporting priorities and system requirements

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Confirmed ERD Design for Manufacturers/Vendors**
- ‚úÖ Verified that ERD supports multiple manufacturers per item via `ItemManufacturerPart` junction table
- ‚úÖ Confirmed multiple vendors per item via `VendorItem` table
- ‚úÖ Clarified that G-codes are the primary item identifier
- ‚úÖ Established that vendor selection happens at Order level, not OrderLine level

### 2. **Mapped Complete Inventory Workflows**

**Sales Orders:**
- Work at ITEM level only (G-codes)
- No vendor data on order lines
- Pull from warehouse inventory using FIFO
- Create InventoryMovement records with actual costs

**Purchase Orders:**
- Vendor specified at ORDER level
- Order lines reference items (G-codes)
- Look up VendorItem for vendor's SKU and pricing
- Receiving creates inventory layers with unit costs

**Job Costing:**
- Track actual material costs via InventoryMovement.work_order_id
- Use FIFO costing to pull from oldest inventory layers first
- Show both actual cost (FIFO) and current replacement cost
- Track cost variance for better future estimates

### 3. **Designed FIFO Inventory Layer System**

**New Table: `inventory_layers`**
- Tracks each receipt of inventory with its specific cost
- Fields: layer_id, item_id, location_id, bin_id, qty_remaining, unit_cost, received_at, purchase_order_id
- Sorted by received_at for FIFO ordering
- Automatically created when receiving POs

**Updated Table: `inventory_movements`**
- Added: unit_cost, total_cost, is_estimated, actual_cost_variance
- Tracks both estimated costs (for pending allocations) and actual costs (FIFO)
- Links to work_order_id for job costing

**Service Layer: `FIFOInventoryService`**
- `receive_inventory()` - Creates layers on PO receipt
- `allocate_inventory_fifo()` - Pulls from oldest layers first
- `get_layer_breakdown()` - Returns cost layer details for UI
- `transfer_inventory()` - Moves inventory between locations preserving costs

### 4. **Defined Negative Inventory Strategy**

**Business Rule: Allow Negative Inventory with Notifications**
- Users can allocate materials even when insufficient stock
- System allocates what exists using FIFO
- Creates `PendingAllocation` record for shortage
- Uses estimated cost (last known or current replacement cost)
- Sends notification to warehouse staff
- Auto-fulfills pending allocations when PO received
- Tracks cost variance between estimated and actual

**New Table: `pending_allocations`**
- Tracks material shortages that will be fulfilled from future receipts
- Fields: pending_allocation_id, item_id, work_order_id, qty, estimated_unit_cost, status
- Automatically fulfilled when matching inventory received

### 5. **Clarified All Order Types**

| Order Type | From | To | Purpose |
|------------|------|-----|---------|
| PURCHASE | Vendor | GSE Location | Buy materials/tools |
| SALES | GSE Location | Customer/Job | Sell or allocate to job |
| TRANSFER | GSE Location | GSE Location | Move between warehouse/trucks |
| RMA | GSE Location | Vendor | Return defective items |
| RETURN | Customer | GSE Location | Customer returns |

**Critical Clarification:**
- Work Orders are NOT inventory-related (they're job tasks/schedules)
- Job sites are NOT inventory locations
- Inventory only exists in GSE-controlled locations (warehouses, trucks, shops)

### 6. **Established Business Requirements**

**Inventory Management:**
- 20 inventory locations (warehouses, trucks, shops)
- ~400 active jobs at once
- Typical job duration: 120 days
- 3 warehouse staff
- Just-in-time allocation approach
- Manual PO creation with low stock alerts at min_qty threshold

**Cost Tracking Philosophy:**
- Show ACTUAL cost (FIFO) for job costing and profitability
- Show CURRENT REPLACEMENT cost for quoting new jobs
- Display cost variance to understand savings/overages
- Flag when using old inventory vs current prices
- Preserve FIFO cost even on returns

**Multi-Location Strategy:**
- Ask user which location to pull from (no auto-selection)
- Manual approval required for location transfers
- Each location tracks its own inventory layers

### 7. **Prioritized Reporting Requirements**

**Top 8 Reports (in priority order):**
1. Job profitability (revenue - material cost)
2. Material cost variance (budgeted vs actual)
3. Cost trend analysis (prices going up/down)
4. Inventory valuation (what's our inventory worth)
5. Purchase order tracking (what's on order)
6. Slow-moving inventory alerts
7. Material usage by job/customer
8. Vendor performance (cost, delivery time)

### 8. **Designed Pick Ticket System**

**High-Priority Feature (matching user's existing spreadsheet):**
- Generate PDF pick tickets for sales orders
- Sort by bin location for efficient picking
- Include barcode support for future scanning
- Show stock availability warnings
- Group by location if items spread across warehouses
- Multi-page support for large orders
- Picker sign-off section
- Integration with inventory allocation (FIFO)

**Features:**
- Preview before printing
- Email to warehouse
- Mobile-friendly view
- Reprint capability
- Mark as fulfilled workflow

### 9. **Planned Integration Requirements**

**Phase 1 (Core):**
- None - build standalone first

**Future Phases:**
- QuickBooks Online integration (accounting sync)
- Customer portal (job status viewing and requests)
- Mobile app for field crews (barcode scanning)
- Time tracking (maybe)
- Vendor portals (maybe)

## üìù Key Decisions Made

### 1. **FIFO Costing Method**
**Decision:** Implement full FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory costing with layer tracking

**Reasoning:**
- Most accurate job costing
- Matches physical flow of materials
- Standard accounting practice for construction
- Better for price variance analysis
- More complex but worth it for accuracy

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Average cost: Too simple, hides variances
- LIFO: Not IFRS compliant, less common in construction

### 2. **Negative Inventory Approach**
**Decision:** Allow negative inventory with notifications and pending allocation tracking

**Reasoning:**
- Jobs can't be blocked by temporary stock shortages
- Real-world scenario: allocate materials before they arrive
- Tracking pending allocations enables accurate cost estimates
- Auto-fulfillment when PO received reduces manual work
- Cost variance tracking improves future estimates

**Implementation:**
- Create pending_allocations table
- Use estimated costs until fulfilled
- Flag inventory items with negative stock
- Send notifications to warehouse
- Auto-fulfill on receipt

### 3. **Cost Display Strategy**
**Decision:** Show both actual FIFO cost AND current replacement cost

**Reasoning:**
- Actual cost (FIFO): For job profitability and costing
- Current cost: For quoting new jobs accurately
- Variance: Shows savings from using old inventory or price increases
- Helps with bidding: "Wire nuts cost $5 but now $6, adjust quotes"

### 4. **Order Type Definitions**
**Decision:** Unified Order model with strict type definitions and workflows

**Reasoning:**
- Sales orders: Always from GSE location to customer/job
- Purchase orders: Always from vendor to GSE location
- No direct vendor ‚Üí job shipments (simplifies tracking)
- Work orders are separate from inventory (job management)
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. **Pick Ticket Priority**
**Decision:** Build pick ticket system in Phase 1 (core feature)

**Reasoning:**
- User has existing spreadsheet solution (proves need)
- Critical for warehouse efficiency
- Integrates with FIFO allocation
- Enables barcode scanning foundation
- Relatively simple to implement

### 6. **Barcode Scanning Timing**
**Decision:** Design for barcodes now, implement in Phase 3

**Reasoning:**
- Include barcode fields in ERD now (avoid migration later)
- Print barcodes on pick tickets from day 1
- Build scanning app after core system proven
- Reduces initial complexity
- Allows manual process during early adoption

### 7. **Location Strategy**
**Decision:** Manual location selection, no auto-allocation

**Reasoning:**
- User wants control over which warehouse/truck
- 20 locations - too complex for auto-selection
- Proximity/cost logic too business-specific
- Can add auto-suggest later if needed
- Keeps system simple and predictable

## üîß Technical Design Decisions

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**

**New Tables:**
- `inventory_layers` - FIFO cost layer tracking
- `pending_allocations` - Negative inventory tracking

**Updated Tables:**
- `inventory_movements` - Add unit_cost, total_cost, is_estimated, actual_cost_variance
- `items` - Add current_replacement_cost (for quoting)

### 2. **Service Layer Architecture**

**Created: `FIFOInventoryService`**
- Encapsulates all FIFO logic
- Handles layer creation on receipt
- Manages allocation from oldest layers first
- Auto-fulfills pending allocations
- Calculates cost variances
- Thread-safe with Django transactions

### 3. **API Endpoints Needed**

**Inventory:**
- GET `/api/inventory/layers/` - Layer breakdown for item/location
- POST `/api/inventory/estimate-allocation-cost/` - Cost preview before allocation
- POST `/api/inventory/allocate-to-job/` - FIFO allocation with pending support
- GET `/api/inventory/negative-stock/` - List items with negative inventory

**Pick Tickets:**
- POST `/api/orders/{order_id}/generate-pick-ticket/` - Generate PDF
- GET `/api/orders/{order_id}/pick-ticket/` - View/reprint
- POST `/api/orders/{order_id}/mark-fulfilled/` - Complete picking

**Alerts:**
- GET `/api/inventory/low-stock/` - Items approaching min_qty
- GET `/api/inventory/pending-fulfillments/` - Outstanding pending allocations
- GET `/api/inventory/cost-variances/` - Significant price changes

### 4. **Frontend Components**

**New Pages:**
- `InventoryLayerView.jsx` - Show cost layers for item
- `AllocateToJob.jsx` - Job allocation with cost preview
- `PickTicket.jsx` - Generate and print pick tickets
- `NegativeInventoryAlert.jsx` - Dashboard warning widget

**Enhanced Pages:**
- `Items.jsx` - Add cost layer display
