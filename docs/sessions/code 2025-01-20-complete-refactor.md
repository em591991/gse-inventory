---

## üìù Key Decisions Made

### 1. **Unified Order Model**
**Decision:** Use single `Order` model with `order_type` field instead of separate PurchaseOrder, SalesOrder, etc. models.

**Reasoning:** 
- Matches ERD specification exactly
- Reduces code duplication
- Simplifies order processing logic
- All order types share 80% of same fields

### 2. **UUID Primary Keys**
**Decision:** Use explicit UUID fields (`item_id`, `order_id`, etc.) as primary keys instead of Django's default auto-increment `id`.

**Reasoning:**
- Matches ERD specification
- Better for distributed systems
- Prevents ID collision in data imports
- More secure (non-sequential)

### 3. **App Organization Strategy**
**Decision:** Group related models by business domain, not one-app-per-table.

**Structure:**
- `inventory`: Item, Location, Bin, Movements, UOM
- `manufacturers`: Manufacturer models
- `vendors`: Vendor and VendorItem
- `orders`: All order types
- `customers`: Customer data
- `jobs`: Job and WorkOrder
- Future: `assets` (tools, equipment, vehicles)

**Reasoning:**
- Reduces app sprawl (60 tables ‚Üí 10-12 apps)
- Logical grouping improves maintainability
- Follows Django best practices

### 4. **Field Naming Convention**
**Decision:** Use explicit, descriptive field names from ERD.

**Examples:**
- `item_name` not `name`
- `item_id` not `id`
- `g_code` (exact from ERD)
- `ordered_at` not `created_at`

**Reasoning:**
- Eliminates ambiguity
- Makes code self-documenting
- Ensures ERD compliance

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: Import Error for `OrderItem`
**Error:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'OrderItem' from 'orders.models'`

**Cause:** Old references to `OrderItem` after renaming to `OrderLine`

**Solution:** 
- Found all instances of `OrderItem` with Ctrl+Shift+F
- Replaced with `OrderLine` in:
  - `orders/admin.py`
  - `orders/serializers.py`
  - `orders/views.py`

### Issue 2: Field Name Mismatch (`created_at` vs `ordered_at`)
**Error:** `FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'created_at'`

**Cause:** Order model uses `ordered_at` but old code referenced `created_at`

**Solution:**
- Used VS Code Find & Replace
- Searched for `created_at` in `backend/orders/`
- Replaced with `ordered_at` in:
  - serializers.py
  - views.py
  - admin.py (if present)

### Issue 3: Migration Dependency Errors
**Error:** `NodeNotFoundError: Migration orders.0002_mymodel dependencies reference nonexistent parent node`

**Cause:** Deleted some migrations but not all, creating broken chain

**Solution:**
- Deleted ALL migration files in affected apps (kept `__init__.py`)
- Recreated fresh migrations:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations manufacturers
  python manage.py makemigrations inventory
  python manage.py makemigrations orders
  python manage.py makemigrations vendoritems
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

### Issue 4: Database File Path Error (rm command)
**Error:** `Cannot find path 'db.sqlite3'`

**Cause:** Database file didn't exist yet

**Solution:** No action needed - this was expected for first-time setup

## üí° Key Learnings

### What Went Well:
1. ‚úÖ Having the ERD as reference made assessment clear
2. ‚úÖ Systematic approach (one app at a time) prevented confusion
3. ‚úÖ Fresh migrations resolved dependency issues cleanly
4. ‚úÖ Ground rules established early will prevent future drift

### What Was Challenging:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration dependencies required complete reset
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Finding all references to renamed models took time
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Balancing Django conventions with ERD exactness requires judgment

### Best Practices Confirmed:
1. ‚úÖ ERD as source of truth prevents scope creep
2. ‚úÖ Small, testable changes with migrations after each step
3. ‚úÖ Comprehensive search (Ctrl+Shift+F) essential for refactoring
4. ‚úÖ Document decisions immediately while context is fresh

## üìù Notes for Future Sessions

### When Starting New Chat:
1. Reference this session summary
2. Check ERD before making changes
3. Use custom instructions in Claude Project
4. Ask for ERD verification when unsure

### Quick Status Check Command:
```bash
# See current models
python manage.py showmigrations

# Verify no import errors
python manage.py check

# Test in shell
python manage.py shell
>>> from inventory.models import Item
>>> Item.objects.all()
```

### Migration Best Practices:
- Always backup db before major changes
- Delete db.sqlite3 if starting fresh (dev only!)
- Run makemigrations after EVERY model change
- Test migrations before committing
